 # ChatGPT's Role in Education 
The emergence of ChatGPT has brought unprecedented influence to our daily lives and how human beings utilize artificial intelligence. As individuals who have just embarked on our journeys of exploring the knowns and unknowns of knowledge, students, without a doubt, bear the most impact from the use of ChatGPT. In this document, I aim to discuss supporting and opposing views on whether ChatGPT should be used in education.

## Article 1 
In the article [ChatGPT May Lead To The Downfall Of Education And Critical Thinking][Opposing Article], the author emphasizes the severity of how ChatGPT reduces creativity. One of the most important aspects of education is to stimulate critical thinking and enhance creativity. Before ChatGPT, students were motivated to brainstorm new ideas. With the distinctive and diverse minds all around the world, students managed to come up with innovative solutions and approaches to problems. However, ChatGPT reduces students' creativity and the opportunity to think by providing pre-written responses. These easily acquired responses diminish students' incentive to think for themselves and limit their ability to express self-driven solutions and ideas.

## Article 2
However, the article [Donâ€™t Ban ChatGPT in Schools. Teach With It.][Supporting Article] highlights how ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for education when used correctly. One of the key points mentioned in the article is that in a world where AI and generative models are becoming more and more prevalent, teachers should help students understand how to utilize ChatGPT while acknowledging its impact, weaknesses, biases, and potential misuses. In other words, teachers are responsible for guiding students in using ChatGPT appropriately and helping them understand ChatGPT's limitations.
